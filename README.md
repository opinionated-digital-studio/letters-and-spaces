Quickly build beautiful responsive flexbox-based grid layouts with modular typography and vertical rhythm using the Letters and Spaces SASS framework. This framework:
- Uses REMs to respect user font size settings
- Provides mixins to set font sizes and line-heights based on a preset and configurable modular scale 
- Provides mixins to responsively handle margin and padding spacing whilst maintaining vertical rhythm
- Sets base font sizes responsively (i.e. different base font sizes per breakpoint)
- Uses and provides classes for a responsive flexbox-based grid and column system

## Quick start

There are three ways to start using this framework in your app.

1. [Download the latest relase](https://github.com/opinionated-digital-studio/letters-and-spaces/releases/latest)
2. Git clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/opinionated-digital-studio/letters-and-spaces.git` 
3. Install with [NPM](https://npmjs.com) `npm install letters-and-spaces --save-dev`

Whilst you can use the compiled CSS as a normalize, you can get the most value out of this framework
by importing the framework with the `@use` rule in SASS and configuring your own variables. 
That way, you can extend on the work by using the mixins to maintain vertical rhythm in your project.
